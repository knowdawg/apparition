"FirstContact1" : 

"Please, someone, anyone. Please give me a sign that i'm not alone here.",

"FirstContact2" : 

"Another person? I never even entertained the idea! My name is John. I have been here for ages just like you. I am trying to hold back my excitement! What is your name? Where are you from? Oh, I pray to God that this isn't another one of this places tricks.",

"FirstContact3" : 

"Thank God! I am holding back tears as I write. My name is Chrin and I'm from Southern Callisto. How long have you been stuck here? I think this is about my fifteenth-ish time. I'm not sure, I lost track a while ago.",

"FirstContact4" : 

"Callisto, huh? It rings a bell but I don't know where exactly it is. Please forgive my poor geography skills, I may have slept through most of my high school humanities. I'm from the United States by the way. Make sure to tell me about Callisto in your next message. 
As for how long I've been here, definitely not fifteen loops. Maybe 10? It is really easy to forget how long you've been in this place. 
As a final note, perhaps we should label our messages with our names. Like I would put 'John:' before each of my messages. I can see reading our past messages becoming difficult if we don't keep our conversation organized.",

"FirstContact5" : "Chrin: 
		
I love that idea! And don't worry about your lack of knowledge when it comes to countries because I have never heard of your home country either! What planet or moon is the United States on? Callisto orbits Jupiter, and it's kinda just a generic pseudo-planet. There are a few cool sights that the terraforming didn't completely destroy but they are dwarfed compared to the sights on Earth.",

"FirstContact6" : 

"What? Are you telling me that i'm not the only person in this hell hole? I suppose I should have started this with 'Halit:' because that is my name and all. And what the hell are you both talking about? Jupiter, Callisto, United States? I recognize Earth but that's a given. Please give me the locations of these places, I am quite interested.",

"FirstContact7" : "Sam: 
		
Oh. My. GOSH! I Found your book! It took me a while to read through all that writing but I did it! My name is Sam and I have been here for a really long time. I am from Io. The weather is really nice and has the best ocean in the entire universe! Miss Chrin, my grandparents live on Callisto. Also, you see how I put my name at the start? I am way smarter than Mr. Halit.",

"FirstContact8" : "John: 
		
I am delighted that there are more than two people trapped here. However, I am so confused. Moons? You are both on moons? Also, I can see all of this becoming very confusing, everyone writing about different things and having different conversations. We also must consider that there could be more people other than us. I don't want someone's first interaction with another person to be riddled with confusion. Chrin, do you have any other books? Perhaps we could store different conversations in separate books.",

"FirstContact9" : "Chrin: 
		
Every time I re-awake, I have another book. However, if I leave it in anywhere other than a few locations, it will have disappeared when I next re-awake. I'll place another book in a secluded area against a wall a few rooms down. I think there we should discuss how best to organize these conversations there.",

"FirstContact10" : "Sam:

I can't find it! Can someone please tell me better instructions?
Nevermind I found it",





"RulesOrder1" : "Chrin:

This book will be for the discussion on how we organize future messages. We already have one rule : one must list their name before each entry. Also, we seem to be putting each of our messages on a separate page. I think we should keep it this way as I don’t see us running out of space. List any other recommendations below this entry.",

"RulesOrder2" : "John:

Chrin, I believe that our first priority should be to locate as many spots that are safe for books. I urge you to place a book in a different location every re-awakening so we can have books in as many locations as possible. Also, I think that each book should have a unique idea behind it. For example, a book about our seemingly vastly different home planets.",

"RulesOrder3" : "Dr. Cody Klien:

Assuming that there could be any number of people in this structure, we should use both our first and last names to further distinguish ourselves. Additionally, I think we should define some vocabulary so that we are all on the same page about certain concepts. I have taken the liberty of creating a few to start out based on your previous conversation.

Apparition : The name of this structure we are trapped in. I think this name is fitting due to our nature of communication and also because we are all seemingly undead.

Re-Awakening : The process of awaking at the start of the Apparition after we die.",

"RulesOrder4" : "Halit Baur:

RESPONSE TO JOHN: Moron, moons aren’t planets.

Anyways, due to the nature of this system of ‘communication’, we should have a syntax for responding to people in a direct way. Take note how I did my response. Make it big so it pops out. Also, make sure to include the exact signature of the message you are responding to to avoid confusion.",

"RulesOrder5" : "Shiro Spark:

We should introduce time to our signatures. Since there is seemingly no way to tell time in the Apparition, we will make our own. With a unique book in an obvious location, every time someone re-awakens, they increment a number in this book by one. Then they will write this time next to the signatures for any messages they write.

Additionally, I wish for a book to be dedicated to the investigation into our languages. Assuming that some of you are actually from the Origin System, I doubt all of our languages are the same. And yet we can all read each other's writing.",

"RulesOrder6" : "John Person:

I think our primary goal should be to understand this Apparition and how it works. Saying we are trapped here is a bit grim wouldn't you say? I say we are simply voyagers on an utterly massive ocean. Have faith, friends!",

"RulesOrder7" : "Shrin Piler:

I have spent the past few re-awakenings placing books. I believe I have found the perfect location for our rules. Make sure you stop by the serpent banner room this awakening!",









"CodySparkTalk1" : 
"Dr. C
Loop : 1122

This conversation is only between Dr. Cody Klien and Shiro Spark. 
Looking further into this conversation will be considered an infringement upon the laws of the Apparition.",

"CodySparkTalk2":
"Dr. C
Loop 1122

The Genesis Engine may be terrifying, but it is also beautiful. What do you think, Shiro? Are we in Hell or have we ascended from our mortal coil?",

"CodySparkTalk3" : 
"Shiro
Loop 1127

It's like John said, Doctor. It doesn't really matter if the Apparition is malevolent or benevolent; we are stuck here non the less.
What is this really about? Are you feeling well, Doctor?",

"CodySparkTalk4" :
"Dr C
Loop 1128

There is a concept from my time known as Moore’s Law. It was originally a way to describe computer chips but it can be applied to any quickly advancing field. Progress is fast at first but then it slows down until it seemingly stops. 
I fear we have already reached that point. We seemingly know everything we can about the Apparition and yet we are no closer to escaping than when we started.
You are from the Lightless Era, Shiro. How much more powerful are computers that far into the future?",

"CodySparkTalk5" : 
"Shiro
Loop 1131

Doctor, we still have more leads! And there are so many uncertainties in all our theories! A breakthrough could be right around the corner!",

"CodySparkTalk6" : 
"Dr C
Loop 1139

I'm afraid you may be mistaken, Shiro.
The self devouring serpent that can be seen all throughout the Apparition, it depicts a concept from my time. Ouroboros: the representation of the eternal cycle of life and death.
Whoever or whatever put us into this place had no intention of every letting us escape.",


"CodySparkTalk7" : 
"Shiro
Loop 1140

Doctor, we need to find a new location to continue this conversation. One that not even Chrin knows about.",
