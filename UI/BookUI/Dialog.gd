"FirstContact3" : 

"	Yes, a response! My name is Chrin and I'm from Southern Callisto. I’ve been trapped here longer than I can count. lost track a while ago.",

"FirstContact4" : 

"	Callisto, huh? It rings a bell but I don't know where exactly it is. Please forgive my poor geography skills. I'm from the United States by the way.
	As for how long I've been here, maybe 10 lives? It is really easy to forget how long you've been in this place. 
	As a final note, perhaps we should label our messages with our names. I can see reading our past messages becoming difficult if we don't keep our conversation organized.",

"FirstContact5" : "Chrin: 
		
	Great idea! And don't worry about your lack of knowledge when it comes to countries because I have never heard of your country either! What planet or moon is the United States on? Callisto orbits Jupiter, and it's kinda just a generic pseudo-planet.",

"FirstContact6" : 

"	What? Are you telling me that I'm not the only person in this hell hole? I suppose I should have started this with 'Halit' because that is my name and all. And what the hell are you both talking about? Jupiter, Callisto, United States? I recognize Earth but that's a given. Please give me the locations of these places, I am quite interested.",

"FirstContact7" : "John: 
		
	I am delighted that there are more than two people trapped here. However, I am so confused. You lived on a moon? Also, I can see all of this becoming very confusing, everyone writing about different things and having different conversations. Chrin, do you have any other books? Perhaps we could store different conversations in separate books.",

"FirstContact8" : "Chrin: 
		
	I have another book every time I re-awake here. However, if I leave it in anywhere other than a few locations, it will have disappeared when I next re-awake. I'll place another book in a secluded area against a wall a few rooms down. I think there we should discuss how best to organize these conversations there.",

	This book will be for the discussion on how we organize future messages. We already have one rule : list their name before each entry. Also, we seem to be putting each of our messages on a separate page. I think we should keep it this way as I don’t see us running out of space. List any other recommendations below this entry.",

"RulesOrder2" : "John:

	I believe that our first priority should be to locate as many spots that are safe for books. Chrin, I urge you to place a book in a different location every re-awakening so we can have books in as many locations as possible. Also, I think that each book should have a unique idea behind it. For example, a book about our seemingly vastly different home planets.",

"RulesOrder3" : "Dr. Cody:

	I think we should define some vocabulary so that we are all on the same page about certain concepts. I have taken the liberty of creating a few to start out based on your previous conversation.

	Apparition : The name of this structure we are trapped in. I think this name is fitting due to our nature of communication and also because we are all seemingly undead.

	Re-Awakening : The process of awaking at the start of the Apparition after we die.",

"RulesOrder4" : "Halit:

	RESPONSE TO JOHN: Moron, moons aren’t planets.

	Anyways, due to the nature of this system of communication, we should have a syntax for responding to people in a direct way. Take note how I did my response. Make it big so it pops out. Also, make sure to include the exact signature of the message you are responding to to avoid confusion.",

"RulesOrder5" : "Shiro:

	We should introduce time to our signatures. Since there is seemingly no way to tell time in the Apparition, we will make our own. With a unique book in an obvious location, every time someone re-awakens, they increment a number in this book by one. Then they will write this time next to the signatures for any messages they write.

	Additionally, I wish for a book to be dedicated to the investigation into our languages. Assuming that some of you are actually from the Origin System, I doubt all of our languages are the same. And yet we can all read each other's writing.",

"RulesOrder6" : "John:

	I think our primary goal should be to understand this Apparition and how it works.

Loop 22

	So this may be a bit of a touchy subject but… did you all die before waking up here? I remember my death quite vividly and due to us all being from different times I have assumed that we are in the afterlife.",

"Halit
Loop 24

	Afterlife? Yeah, maybe if we all got sent to hell. You really need to give this whole religious perspective a break. It’s not in any way helpful to our situation.

"Death3" : 
"Dr. C
Loop 25

	Many angles to the same problem are always helpful however I disagree with you here, John. The Apparition seems too odd to be connected to a god. I think a more reasonable conclusion is that we are all far into the future, even past the Age of Darkness.
	As for evidence, the Apparition seems to be orbiting a black hole, similar to humans during the Age of Darkness.",

"Death4" : 
"Shiro
Loop 27

	I think we are all purposely ignoring an obvious possibility: that none of this is actually real. The only thing we each can be certain of is that we each died. We shouldn’t ignore the chance that this is all just a hallucination created by our minds on the verge of death.",

"Death5" :

Loop 28

	I actually think we can immediately dismiss the possibility of all this being fake. By your logic, Shiro, even our past lives cannot be trusted. I know all too well the philosophy you are invoking and I also know that line of thinking is absolutely useless.

Loop 3

Based on previous conversations, I believe that we are all from drastically different time periods. Due to this, I would like to pose a few questions.
First, When was each of you born? Since most people here seem to be from the Origin System, we will use the Gregorian Calendar. I was born during the Age of Darkness which would be around 21000.
Second, how do you think we can each understand each other? I don’t believe any languages from the Origin System survived to the Age of Darkness and yet we all seem to be able to understand each other perfectly fine.
As a small experiment, this last sentence is written in a language different from the previous paragraphs.",

"Time2" : 

"Chrin
Loop 4

I was born in the year 3438. During my time, the entire solar system was being rapidly terraformed. However, moving from celestial body to body was not an easy task. Most people spent their entire lives on the planet or moon that they were born on.
	Shiro, you said you were from the Age of Darkness. What is that, what was life like around that time? I urge everyone to briefly explain their time periods in their responses.
	I don’t have the faintest idea how we can all understand each other but I can read the final paragraph you wrote.",

"Time3" : 

"Dr. C
Loop 6

I was born in the year 2150. There was no space travel in my life but many probes were sent into space. Overall, progress was incredibly slow during my lifetime to the point where I don’t even know anything of worth to mention.
Shiro, I have taken your language experiment to the next level:
This sentence is written in a language that I created on the spot.
Perhaps the Apparition somehow translates what we write to the language of whoever is currently in the Apparition.",

"Time4" : 

"Shiro
Loop 7

I can understand your language, doctor. More interestingly, however, the test I wrote has been translated into the language I am most familiar with. I think this confirms that the Apparition or something in the Apparition (perhaps those ink monsters) is translating our writing.
	As for the Age of Darkness, it is a subsection of the Lightless Era. Humanity had long since spread to the stars, and due to the massive increase in resources, multiplied at an unprecedented rate. Over the next few millennia, nearly all resources in the observable universe were consumed. This started the Lightless Era.
	The Age of Darkness seemed to me to be the end of the Lightless Era. There are no stars, only black holes and ships that orbit around them. I ended up freezing to death after a life support component in my ship broke. Nobody knew how to fix it or make a new one.",

"Time5" : 

"Dr C
Loop 8

	This also means that the Apparition somehow wants us to communicate with each other. This is absolutely monumental as this means the Apparition has some sort of goal or end.",

"Time6" : 

"Halit
Loop 9

	Looks like my people really screwed you good then, Shiro! I am from the Era of Stars, most notable for incredible amounts of space travel and an absolute shit ton of people! I guess those scientists were right then, overpopulation did kill the universe!
	I believe that during my time, there were something like over a billion billion people accounted for. Exponential growth is truly wild!",

"Time7" : 

"Shiro
Loop 11

	You’re wrong, Halit. After the effects of overpopulation became impossible to ignore, people began to stop having children. Exponential growth is fast, but humanity is also capable of immediate and sudden decay. 
Specialization into fields became a thing of the past. Technological advancement froze. Entire planets filled with industry facilities were abandoned. And the population continued to fall out of fear of the heat death. Eventually, we lacked the manpower to lift ourselves out of the darkness. When I died, I was one of a couple hundred people left in the entire universe.
	Overpopulation may have brought humanity to death’s door, but it was underpopulation that sealed its fate.
	Humanity’s greatest folly was attempting to undo their past actions instead of utilizing their current strengths to create a better future.",

	Hey, we have no clue what the Apparition wants! We can communicate with each other, yes, but you are the only one who has books.

Loop 40

	Realy, Halit? How is that in any way helpful?
	I have actually seen the creatures doing some strange things around the Apparition like putting back together a crumbling wall and also fixing a wood bridge. Perhaps they are some sort of care takers?
	Also, I’ve noticed that there are slight changes to the Apparition on each loop. Nothing major, just a slightly narrower hallway and other things along those lines. I could be imagining it, but I doubt it.",

Loop 43

	Jeez, John. No need to call me out for having a bit of fun. At least I'm not a complete downer like the rest of you.

"Monster5":

"Dr. C
Loop 44

	I haven't noticed any changes myself, but I will be on the lookout in the future.
	The only thing we can be truly certain of is that something is creating or at least deploying our bodies at the start of the Apparition. Whether this is a sentient being or some computer is still uncertain though.
	Investigation into the creatures’ corpses reveals that they are in no way organic. I believe that this fact favors the idea that these creatures somehow upkeep the Apparition.",

"Dr. C
Loop 157

	A few things have been on my mind as of late that I would like everyone’s opinion on.
	We have been operating on the idea that we were each chosen randomly to be placed in the Apparition. While this seems reasonable at first, the fact that three of us are from the Origin System and one of us is from the Lightless Era seems incredibly unlikely, especially considering that over 99% of humanity's total population was during the Age of Stars.
	I have come up with a few theories based on this information.
	First, it was simply by chance. This is of course entirely possible but I find it too improbable for us to immediately assume it as true.
	Second, the Age of Stars actually had far fewer people than Shiro and Halit believe. I dislike this idea equally as much as that would mean that Shiro and possibly Halit are lying about where they were from.",

"Parallel2":

"John
Loop 159

	There is also the possibility that us five were chosen by some higher being.
	I agree that it is of absolute importance that we continue to fully trust each other. However, if anyone has written lies, I urge them to confess.",

"Parallel3":

"Shiro
Loop 160

	I have another idea. The Apparition is vast but we seem to be only in a closed off portion of it. We have no idea what is on the outside of our walls. Perhaps there are more groups of people just like ourselves.
	Assuming that there are many groups and assuming that people were chosen randomly for each group, every group would have a different composition of people. It would be of no statistical improbability that at least a few groups would have multiple people from times of low population. Our group would have just happened to be one of those groups.
	Overall, I still don’t think this is true. The seemingly infinite nature of the Apparition mirrors that of the universe and yet humans were still the only intelligent lifeforms to emerge.",

"Parallel4":

"Dr. C
Loop 163

	Then we continue assuming we were selected by chance. However, I don’t think we should ignore the possibility of us being special nor should we ignore the possibility of there being more groups like us out there.",

"Shiro
Loop 1140

	Doctor, your mention of Oroburos reminded me of something. During my life, I met a young engineer set on getting humanity out of the Lightless Era. She had created a fascinating invention that could repair any object as long as all the pieces were present.
	While this may seem incredible, this invention was not without its drawbacks. Every single molecule had to be accounted for to create an object and if even a microscopic piece was missing, the device would create something completely different. Thus, I deemed the invention a fascinating but mostly useless piece of technology.
	It is what she called it that haunts me. The Ouroboros Engine, ‘a serpent that can consume itself throughout time to recreate everything that has been lost.’
	The main issue my people faced during the Lightless Era was actually not the looming approach of the heat death, but the lack of harnessable energy. Black holes may last millennium radiate energy at an extremely slow rate.
	But what would happen if one of these Ouroboros Engines began to feed off the energy from a black hole, one that contains the data of innumerable solar systems?",

"Rebelion2":

"Dr. C
Loop 1141

	I am not so certain about all of this, Shiro. There are so many holes in this theory. However, I can tell that you believe it to be true. Perhaps we can text it in some way? Though, I haven't the slightest idea on how to go about that.",

"Rebelion3":

"Shiro
Loop 1143

	The Apparition has a goal, that is why it allows us to communicate. It needs us but only allows one of us to be present at any given time. I have long since learned how to deal with the creatures of the Apparition and they no longer pose a threat to me. Thus, if I choose not to, I will not die.
	I don’t know how long it will take, but eventually, the Apparition will have to re-create you or one of the others. And if it doesn’t, then I will finally be able to give you all the rest you deserve.
	I will not be held in this purgatory for all of eternity. The Apparition is evil and I must do something to stop it.",
