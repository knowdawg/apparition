	"FirstContact1" : "Please, someone, anyone. Please give me a sign that i'm not alone here.",
	"FirstContact2" : "Another person? I never even entertained the idea! My name is John. I have been here for ages just like you. I am trying to hold back my excitment! What is your name? Where are you from? 
	Oh, I pray to God that this isn't another one of this places tricks.",
	"FirstContact3" : "Thank God! I am holding back tears as I write. My name is Chrin and I'm from Southern Callisto.
	 How long have you been stuck here? I think this is about my fifteenth-ish time. I'm not sure, I lost track a while ago.",
	"FirstContact4" : "Callisto, huh? It rings a bell but I don't know where exactly it is. Please forgive my poor geography skills, I may have slept through most of my high school humanities. 
	I'm from the United States by the way. Make sure to tell me about Callisto in your next message. 
	As for how long I've been here, definatly not fifteen loops. Mabye 10? It is really easy to forget how long youve been in this place. 
	As a final note, perhaps we should label our mesages with our names. Like I would put 'John:' before each of my messages. I can see reading our past mesages becoming dificult if we don't keep our conversation orginized.",
	"FirstContact5" : "Chrin: 
		
		I love that idea! And don't worry about your lack of knowlegde when it comes to countries because I have never heard of your home country either! What planet or moon is the United States on? Callisto orbits Jupiter, and it's a kinda just a generic psudo-planet. There are a few cool sights that the terraforming didn't compleetly destroy but they are dwarfed compared to the sights on Earth.",
	"FirstContact6" : "What? Are you telling me that im not the only person in this hell hole? I supose I should have started this with 'Halit:' because that is my name and all.
	 And what the hell are you both talking about? Jupiter, Callisto, Unites States? I recognize Earth but that's a given. Please give me the locations of these places, I am quite interested.",
	"FirstContact7" : "Sam: 
		
		Oh. My. GOSH! I Found your book! It took me a while to read through all that writing but I did it! 
	My name is Sam and I have been here for a really long time. I am from Io. The weather is really nice and has the best ocean in the entire universe!
	 Miss Chrin, my grandparents live on Callisto. Also, you see how a put my name at the start? I am wayyy smarter than Mr. Halit.",
	"FirstContact8" : "John: 
		
		I am delighted that there is more than two people trapped here. However, I am so confused. Moons? You are both on moons? 
		Also, I can see all of this becoming very confusing, everyone writing about difrent things and having difrent conversations. We also must consider that there could be more people other than us. I don't want someone's first interaction with another person to be riddled with confusion.
		Chrin, do you have any other books? Perhaps we could store difrent conversations in seperate books.",
	"FirstContact9" : "Chrin: 
		
		Every time I re-awake, I have another book. However, if I leave it in anywhere other than a few locations, it will have disapeared when I next re-awake. 
		I'll place another books in a secluded area against a wall a few rooms down. I think there we should discuss how best to orginize these conversations there.",
	"FirstContact10" : "Sam:
		
		I can't find it! Can someone please tell me better instructions?
		
		Nevermind I found it"
